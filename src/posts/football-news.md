  Real Madrid announced the signing of French superstar Kylian Mbappé on a
  five-year deal on Monday, ending one of the longest-running transfer sagas in
  soccer.


  Mbappé’s move from Paris Saint-Germain comes two days after Real won a record-extending 15th European Cup with victory over Borussia Dortmund, adding further star quality to the team’s attack.


  The 25-year-old, who became PSG’s record scorer during the seven years he spent at the French club, will link up with the likes of Vinícius Jr. and Jude Bellingham – two of the world’s best players – in the Spanish capital to form a potential soccer dynasty.


  Mbappé wrote on social media shortly after the announcement was made that the move was “a dream come true.”


  “So happy and proud to join the club of my dream @Real Madrid,” he said alongside a photo of himself when he was younger in a Madrid jacket.


  “Nobody can understand how excited I am right now. Can’t wait to see you, Madridistas, and thanks for your unbelievable support. ¡Hala Madrid!”
